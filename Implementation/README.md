# Maximum Clique Problem
This code intends to analyse the performance of DW2000Q_6 and Advantage_system4.1
at solving the maximum clique problem (see image for a simple example of what a maximum clique of a graph is).

## Usage
There are two main files: 
* "Clique-Problem-RCS.py" implements the maximum clique problem and scans over relative chain strength (RCS)
* "Clique-Problem-Annealing-Time.py" implements the maximum clique problem and scans over annealing times.

In both cases one needs to provide a graph as a text file including its number of vertices, number of edges, and a list of all edges (many examples are given in this folder).
